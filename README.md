## Architecture

This game follows the ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture using Bevy.

| Layer        | Purpose                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Components   | Describe game entities (e.g., Cell, Marker)       |
| Systems      | Logic handlers (input, AI, rendering, gameplay)   |
| Resources    | Global state (game mode, board, statistics)       |
| Events       | Decoupled messaging (player move, game over)      |
| AI Logic     | Pure minimax functions (no Bevy dependency)       |



## AI Logic

The AI supports three difficulty levels:

- ðŸŸ¢ Easy: Random valid moves
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Minimax with depth limit
- ðŸ”´ Hard: Full-depth Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

The AI is implemented in a pure Rust module (`ai_logic.rs`) so it can be unit tested independently of Bevy.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/bevy_tic_tac_toe
cd bevy_tic_tac_toe
cargo run
```
## Usage

Click on an empty cell to make a move. The game ends when...


## Future Plans

- [ ] Mode selector screen with in-game menu
- [ ] Sound effects and visual effects
- [ ] Mobile-friendly UI (larger touch zones)
- [ ] Undo/Redo move history
- [ ] Export match statistics to file
